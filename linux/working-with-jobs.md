## Linux jobs

I use these to switch from vim back to terminal and back again.


## How to

To suspend current task press `ctrl + z`. This will switch back to terminal.

Once task in terminal has been completed type `fg` to bring job back to foreground.

Lists all suspended jobs

```bash
jobs # list all jobs
```

To kill the job:

```bash
kill %1
```

Where %1 is the job number
